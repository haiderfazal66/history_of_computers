        Alan Turing attended one of the top private schools in England, Sherbone School in Dorset. Alan Turing had a 
        very large passion for mathematics, and so did his best friend, Christopher Morcom. Turing thought of Christoper 
        as more than friends and eventually ended up falling in love with him. Seeing Chirstoper was the best part of his
        day. Christopher ended up dying at a very young age due to bovine turberculosis. When Turing found out about this, 
        he was in complete shock as Christopher kept it a secret from him because he didn't want him to worry about him.
        This tragic information took a large toll on Turings life and it affected him quite majorly.
